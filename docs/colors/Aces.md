## What is ACES and Why is it Recommended? :octicons-heart-fill-16:{: .heart-throb} 


The **Academy Color Encoding System (ACES)** - is a free, expandable, device-independent color management and image sharing system developed under the auspices of **the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences**. 

It is also a set of technical specifications for working with color, coding, and transformation.
 
This system allows you **to store all the data of digital images** in the same mathematical space, which allows a more consistent workflow during the transfer of working material between different departments. 

It is also important that ACES allows you to create archival materials with a high dynamic range and wide color gamut, even taking into account possible future devices.
