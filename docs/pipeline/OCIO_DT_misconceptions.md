I often think about this great question asked by Doug Walker at one of our **OpenColorIO** (OCIO) meetings : *what are you trying to solve ?* So in our case, what is this post about ?

In the past year (2021), I have given several talks online about OCIO and the **Academy Color Encoding System**(ACES). I thought it would be useful to put those slides online for two reasons :


- [x] If there is any inaccurracy, anyone can correct me and I’ll be <strong><span style="color:#cf2e2e" class="color">more than happy</span></strong> to update this page.

- [x] With these slides online, I hope I can reach more people and raise awareness about certain topics.</li></ul>



I do not consider myself an expert. I do not believe in this word anymore. We are only human beings, doing our best to understand things. We make mistakes, hopefully learn from them and keep going. So no, <strong><span style="color:#cf2e2e" class="color">I’m not an expert on anything !</span></strong></p>



The only thing I can offer is <strong><span style="color:#cf2e2e" class="color">an artist’s point of view on Color Management</span></strong>. Quite often, I have been lost on where to begin when it comes to OCIO and ACES.  So by writing this post, I hope I can share with you  some useful information.


There is a reason my book starts with two chapters about Color Management. <strong><span style="color:#cf2e2e" class="color">It will give you the fundation to create beautiful images.</span></strong> So I thought it would be interesting to compare various OCIO configs, with a series of visual examples in order to study their strength and flaws.


Really the idea is to look back but <strong><span style="color:#cf2e2e" class="color">NOT</span></strong> judge these historical OCIO configs. <strong><span style="color:#cf2e2e" class="color">Not at all !</span></strong> Huge respect to all the persons who more than ten years ago developed and shared these configs with the community.



## A great community


Some people may find this post too obvious, boring or outdated. Probably ! But I was really interested to go back in time and write this historical analysis on OCIO and Display Transforms. This is post is primarly <strong><span style="color:#cf2e2e" class="color">about my own misconceptions</span></strong>, but hopefully it will help others too !


Please note that <strong><span style="color:#cf2e2e" class="color">I will only talk about OCIOv1 configs</span> </strong>here.


First of all, I would like to thank the <em>Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science</em>s (AMPAS) because without them, I would have probably never discovered this crazy wonderful world of Color Management. ACES has been my entry point to Color Management and I will never be thankful enough for that.


Thanks to them, I have discovered this amazing community of colour nerds and colour scientists, and I would like to personnally thank the following persons for their generosity, sharing and patience with my questions :
