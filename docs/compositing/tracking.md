lift -> shadow, gamma -> midtones, Gain -> highlight 
	
lift == multiply





3 type of tracking

2D track -> Point track

2.5D tracks -> Planar Tracks

3D track -> Camera track


2d
XY motion
Color correction 

any parallax where i try to track myu element ?
ANY ROTATION , 		

2.5
Track planar surfaces, anythin that can be put on a flat grid 


3D track

Shot that introduce parallax and dimentionality that need to be 
reflected in the element you adding

Parallax: 
The relative speeds two separate objects move based
on their distance from the camera. 
Creates the feeling of depth.

Dimensionality:
The relative speeds differents parts of a single object move 
on their distance from the Camera.
Creates the feeling thaht an object is 3 dimensiontal and not a flat plane.
